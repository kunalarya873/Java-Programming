# Java-Programming
Java is used in a wide range of applications, from web development to mobile apps, enterprise systems, and even embedded systems. It is known for its strong emphasis on security and its extensive library of pre-built components, called the Java Development Kit (JDK), which makes it easier for developers to build complex applications.
